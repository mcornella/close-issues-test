Testing closing issues
=======================

This is a mock repository I made to test how GitHub understood close/fix syntax 
when specified in commit messages and pull requests, with a particular focus on
closing multiple issues at once.

If you want the gist, refer to [bit.ly/1mRVu2p](http://bit.ly/1mRVu2p) and
[bit.ly/1mRVjE1](http://bit.ly/1mRVjE1) (take a special look at the Note).

If, however, you'd like to inspect my findings a little bit, you can inspect:

* [Commit history](https://github.com/mcornella/close-issues-test/commits/master)
* [Issues](https://github.com/mcornella/close-issues-test/issues?state=closed).
